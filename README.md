# Layout Exercice 

Don't pay attention to the kittens (if you can!) I made this exercise to practice with responsive design and CSS tools: Grid, Flex and sass.

## Run the project
Clone the repository and run this command into Modulo-1-Layout-Extra folder and open http://localhost:1234 in your browser 

```
parcel .\index.html 
```
